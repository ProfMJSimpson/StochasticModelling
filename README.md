These resources support a 4-lecture shortcourse on Stochasic Transport Modelling that broadly introduces lattice-based random walk models with exlcusion, bias, proliferation and multiple interacting subopopulations.

Elementary software is provided to support the background materials.  The software is written in the open source Julia language that can be downloaded from https://julialang.org/  There are many interfaces for viewing, running and editing the Julia software such as using a Jupyter notebook or visual studio.  I enjoy working with both editors.  

Resources include some hand-written course notes and relevant references from the literature that includes a few pages from Crank's monograph, The Mathematics of Diffusion, and a few pages from Murray's monograph, Mathematical Biology I.  These two references provide background on exact solutions of the linear heat equation and the porous medium equation that are useful for benchmarking/testing numerical algorithms for solving PDE models. An important component of the short course involves solving PDE models numerically.  Our recent 2024 review article available at https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2024.0186 provides more information about implementing elementary method-of-lines style codes in Julia taking advanage of the DifferentialEquations.jl package https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/

Other resources include some previous publications relating to the content of the short-course.
