These resources support a 4-lecture shortcourse on Stochasic Transport Modelling that broadly introduces lattice-based random walk models with exlcusion, bias, proliferation and multiple interacting subopopulation.

Elementary software is provided to support the background materials.  The software is written in the open source Julia language that can be downloaded from https://julialang.org/  There are many interfaces for viewing, running and editing the Julia software such as using a Jupyter notebook or to work with visual studio.  

Resources include some hand-written course notes and relevant references from the literature
